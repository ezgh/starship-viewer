# Starship Viewer

This is the draft project of the Starship Viewer application; where I am going to use https://swapi.dev/ to implement several features, such as:

- Listing starships
- Search among Starships
- Read details of a specific starship
- Load more starships with a load more button

The main technologies this project is using or going to use include:

- React
- Vite for frontend tooling and packaging
- React Router
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS

More info can be found on the final application soon.
